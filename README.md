# My other site (Planned to be toonnongaeoy.moe)
When the old net, meets the new net. (Inspired by [koinuko.pink](https://koinuko.pink/) v5 and v6)

## Plan
- Make a site that compactible with at least Windows XP with Internet Explorer 6.0
- Have some feature like [my site](https://github.com/toonnongaeoy/mysite) that currently up ([toonstorytime.me](https://toonstorytime.me))
  - Like
    - Mobile Support (Responsive)
    - Modern look (But with old 90s - early 2000ish style.)
- Can browse on any web browser even old Netscape Navigator.
- Made almost entirely on Microsoft FrontPage (Yep, right no fancy ide in the town, We back to 90s - early 2000ish with their WYSIWYG editor on the neocity.)
  - (But still use vscode to finalize the website afterwards)

## Setting up
Just throw onto web server that can be flexable with SSL.
