## Feature
- Can browse on IE5+
- Made almost entirely on Microsoft FrontPage (Yep, right no fancy ide in the town, We back to 90s - early 2000ish with their WYSIWYG editor on the neocity.)
  - (But still use vscode to finalize the website afterward)
- Basic Mobile Support (Responsive)

## Setting up
Just throw onto a web server that can be flexable with SSL.
