# My other site (Planned to be toonnongaeoy.moe)
When the old net, meets the new net. (Inspired by [koinuko.pink](https://koinuko.pink/) v5 and v6)

Featuring in #10-day-in-public on Hack Club Slack.

## Feature
- Can browse on any web browser even old Netscape Navigator. (Best viewed on IE4)
- Made almost entirely on Microsoft FrontPage (Yep, right no fancy ide in the town, We back to 90s - early 2000ish with their WYSIWYG editor on the neocity.)
  - (But still use vscode to finalize the website afterward)

## Todo List
- Mobile Support (Responsive)
- A lot of bug , unfinished , didn't do or even the I don't even use page that isn't done already.
- Move from Ghosh Blog to Bear Blog

## Setting up
Just throw onto a web server that can be flexable with SSL.
